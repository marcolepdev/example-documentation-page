# About  
This prohect is part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Design Course in order to get certified and it basically shows a documentation page about Javascript.  

# Technologies Used  
In order to develop this page I only used HTML, in particular the GRID SYSTEM, and CSS. I created a side menu, where each link is linked to a precise section of a page.
